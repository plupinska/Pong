# Patrycja Pong

### Description
Pong is an arcade video game based on the sport of table tennis. My interpretation let's the user play against the AI until either score 5 points. At which point the game is over, but all you need to do is press enter to play another round!

### Architecture and Technologies

- This game is built with JavaScript and uses the Canvas API for rendering the game in the browser.
- An AI player calculates the position of the ball and moves its paddle in that direction, in hopes of beating its human competitor. Don't worry, the AI has the same speed restriction as you do, good luck in beating him!
